##############################

Xilinx® xfOpenCV library is a FPGA device optimized xfOpenCV library intended for application
developers using Zynq®-7000 SoC and Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC and PCIE based (Virtex and U200 ...) devices. xfOpenCV library provides a software interface for computer vision functions accelerated on an FPGA device. 

xfOpenCV library functions are mostly similar in functionality to their OpenCV equivalent. Any deviations, if present, are documented.

.. note:: For more information on the xfOpenCV library prerequisites, see the `Prerequisites <getting-started-with-sdsoc>`. To familiarize yourself with the steps required to use the xfOpenCV library functions, see the `Using the xfOpenCV Library <getting-started-with-sdsoc.html#using-the-xfopencv-library>`.
