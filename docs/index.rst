Vitis Vision Library
##############################

Xilinx® Vitis vision library is a FPGA device optimized Vitis vision library intended for application
developers using Zynq®-7000 SoC and Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC and PCIE based (Virtex and U200 ...) devices. 
Vitis vision library provides a software interface for computer vision functions accelerated on an FPGA device. 

Vitis vision library functions are mostly similar in functionality to their OpenCV equivalent. Any deviations, if present, are documented.
