Release Note
============

2.0
----

The 2.0 release introduces GQE (generic query engine) kernels,
which are post-bitstream programmable
and allow different SQL queries to be accelerated with one xclbin.
It is conceptually a big step from per-query design,
and a sound example of Xilinx's acceleration approach.

Each GQE kernel is essentially a programmable pipeline of
execution step primitives, which can be enabled or bypassed via run-time configuration.

1.0
----

The 1.0 release provides a range of HLS primitives for mapping the execution
plan steps in relational database. They cover most of the occurrence in the
plan generated from TPC-H 22 queries.

These modules work in streaming fashion and can work in parallel
when possible.
