# Build Xilinx Fintech Library
cd  /*path to xf_fintech*/L3/src

**make clean all**





# Build Instuctions

To build the test harness from this directory

cd /*path to xf_fintech*/L3/tests/HestonFD

**make clean all**





# Run Instuctions

Build the FD Heston hw kernel first, instructions can be found at

/*path to xf_fintech*/L2/tests/FdEuropeanHestonEngine/README.md

Once built copy the kernel file into this directory, i.e. for a U250 the kernel will be named

**fd_heston_kernel_u250_m8192_double.xclbin**


The test will then run on the first device found and compare the precanned CSV results from the python model to that generated by the kernel & produce a summary of results

**make run**
